\section{Introduction}
%     Source - Wikipedia

Classifying entanglement is essential because not all quantum states are equally useful for quantum information tasks. Different types of entanglement serve as distinct resources, each suited to specific applications such as quantum algorithms or secure communication protocols like quantum key distribution. Understanding and identifying these entanglement types helps determine how quantum states can be used and manipulated effectively. hi hi hi this is testing


SLOCC (Stochastic Local Operations and Classical Communication) is a method for classifying quantum entanglement. It defines equivalence classes of quantum states based on whether they can be converted into each other using local operations (on individual qubits) and classical communication. 

This idea has been used successfully to study three-qubit states, as shown in [1,2], classifying four-qubit states [3â€“6] Methods have been developed for handling systems with even more qubits [7,8].

In this paper, the authors have proposed an alternative classification scheme for quantum entanglement based on topological links.


One of the first images that comes to mind when we think of entanglement is that of entangled threads. Naturally, one wonders if we could study quantum entanglement using entangled 'knots'. Aravind~\cite{Aravind} was the first to point out the connections between entangled quantum states and classical knot configurations, focussing on similarity between 3-particle GHZ state and Borromean rings. He associated each particle with a ring, entanglement of any set of particles as inability to separate their corresponding rings, and measurement of particle state as cutting its ring. But he noted that performing the measurement in different basis would not lead to the same conclusions. This limit in analogy was dealt with by Sugita~\cite{Sugita}. He proposed that cutting the ring is equivalent to tracing out the corresponding particle from the density operator, which is a basis-independent operation. This represents viewing the system as though that particle is no longer present. Moreover, the trace operation helps to generalise the idea to quantum systems with more than 2 levels.
